# nestable_matryoshkas
Our program is designed to calculate the number of nestable matryoshkas (also known as Russian nesting dolls) given the size of the largest and smallest matryoshka, as well as the percentage by which the next smallest matryoshka should be.

The user will be prompted to enter these parameters, after which the program will calculate the number of nestable matryoshkas. We will implement this calculation once recursively and once iteratively, providing users with the flexibility to choose the approach that best suits their needs.

We will also conduct a field experiment, testing our program's performance and accuracy using 25 random sets of parameters. The results of this experiment will be documented in a CSV file, allowing users to review the data and compare the recursive/iterative implementations.
